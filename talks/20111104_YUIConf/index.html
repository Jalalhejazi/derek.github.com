        <h1>What is this talk about?</h1>
        <!--
            So what is this talk about?  That's a good question.  
            It's a bit more philosophical than most of the talks you'll see here at YUIConf.
            I originally wanted to give a talk on porting an application from another library to YUI, but I felt that was missing 
            the story of why you would want to do that in the first place.  
            So as I talked to other developers on the YUI team and within the community about their favorite parts of the library, 
            and why it is they used YUI, I began to see some patterns emerge.  
            So this talk is a reflection of those conversations. 
            
            In short, it's a talk about what makes YUI the most uniquely ideal toolkit to build high-scale, maintainable Web applications.

            The International Space Station wasn't designed with beauty in mind, but it's undeniably there.
            To me, the beauty of this picture isn't really because of any visual elements, but when I see it, I imagine the design of the structure depicted.
            
            When we talk about architecture in the sense of software, we're talking about something very similar to the design of something like the IIS.
            Well architected software is composed of reusable and interchangeable components in a way that promotes reliability, maintainability, 
            compatibility, and extensibility.
            
            So let's take a look at some of those "ilities"

        <h1>Modularity</h1>
        
        <!--
            Modules are a concept used across many engineering disciplines.  
            In a space station sense, they refer to the 32 separately constructed components that compose the IIS.
            In a software sense, they similarly refer to bits of focused, interchangeable components that you can use to construct whatever system you are tasked with.
            You'll find native module support in many programming languages.  Ruby, Java, Python.  But unfortunately not in JavaScript.  Why?
            Well, it's pretty obvious.  JavaScript was developed over the course of a few weeks.  I don't think that was a consideration at the time.
            Well, to everyone's surprise though, JS has thrived, and the need for them is here, 
            so it's been left up to developers to design their own module patterns.

        <h2>JS Modules</h2>

        <!-- 
            Here is just one example of a JavaScript module, as proposed on the yuiblog 4 years ago.
            You start with assigning an anonymous function to whatever you want to name your module.  
            Inside this module, you can create whatever private variables you'd like, 
            and you return an object containing things you would like to publicly expose.
            Finally, you execute and return your anonymous function.
            
            There are a number of strengths and weaknesses to this design, 
            and over time, the YUI team finally settled on similar, but slightly different design for YUI3.

            This module does the exact same thing the previous example did, the implementation is slightly different though.

            You have the same capabilities for private members, and whatever you'd like to expose to the public is attached to the Y object.

            Modules are a fundamental building block for everything you do in YUI.  Between the Core library and the YUI Gallery, 
            you'll see over 600 modules that you can use inside of your application to do everything from DOM manipulation,
            animation, object-oriented helpers, and many more.

            It is not intended that you use all of them at the same time, but rather to pick and chose only the ones you want.

            YUI is one of the few popular JavaScript libraries that uses this modular architecture, 
            but we're seeing greater adoption from other libraries.  
            We're even starting to see standards emerge, such as AMD and CommonJS.
            
            Dojo is has recently adopted the AMD pattern, and Node.js has popularized CommonJS Modules/1.1.
            
            YUI is really happy with YUI Modules so far, but that's not to say we haven't begun exploring additional support for other formats.
            If you compare all the specs, YUI is kind of a mixture between the two.  
            If you are curious about the work being done here, check out the YUI forum for discussion about this topic.  
            We're very interested in hearing your feedback.

            The eventual goal is native ECMAScript modules, which are coming, but they're still in the proposal phase.  
            When they've finally arrived, we still won't be able to use them in an environment that needs to support legacy browsers because they 
            won't be compatible with ES3, so I'm not sure how much adoption they'll actually have inside of browsers.  We'll see.
            
            This makes it even more important that we as a JavaScript community come up with a standard that it both backwards, and forwards compatible,
            and one that also runs equally as well server-side and within browsers.

            In application development, one constant is change.  This is especially true on the Web where new ideas, 
            technologies, patterns, techniques, libraries, and standards, are all evolving at an accelerated pace.
            
            Years ago, when I was working on a startup that was using jQuery, a new feature we needed was a rich text editor.
            So I did what most jquery users do, search "jquery rich text editor plugin."  I came across lots of blog posts
            "top 12 jQuery editor plugins", "10 jquery-based rich text editors to blow your mind"  This stuff reads like a Cosmo magazine.
            
            So I click through each one, play around with the demo, figure out which one most meets my spec, paste it in, glue it together, viola. Done.
            
            2 weeks later, "Oh, we need the ability to upload and add pictures within the editor."
            Now my first thought is "Gee, that would have been great to know a few weeks ago."  But that still doesn't change the problem I have.  
            I now have a feature that I need to integrate with an editor that it was never designed to support.
            Sure I could crack open the plugin and start hacking away until I got it working, or just gave up and try another editor.
            
            The point of this is...

            Most of our business cards say something similar to "front end engineer", "web engineer".  
            Well, where do you think the "engineer" part comes from?  
            Our jobs are not to throw together a pile of code, deliver it to the next person who will hack in some modifications, 
            and then deliver that so some other poor sap that is in charge of maintaining it.
            You just end up with unmaintainable junk that is thrown away when it no longer fits a spec, 
            and the process is destined to repeat itself over again.
            
            Every component within YUI is developed with extensibility in mind.  
            Some of the teams that use YUI within Yahoo never use the vanilla versions of the components we have.  
            They endlessly modify and extend them to suit their exact needs.

            YUI is just a suite of tools that naturally evolved to suit the needs of Yahoo, the team, and our community.
            You can use as many, or as few of the tools as you like.  Again, extensible design.

            YUI is called a library, but I personally view it more as a toolkit.  That's not saying the "library" term is incorrect.  
            Library, toolkit, and sometimes framework are often used interchangeably, so I don't want to get lost in semantics.  
            The reason I say 'toolkit' most accurately describes YUI is because it allows you to pick & choose what it is you want, and nothing more.

        <h2>Modular loading</h2>

        <!-- 
            Let's take a look at a pretty typical page that is using a modular, or a psuedo-modular method of organizing code.
            You have the core library which you need to load in first, then you start including your modules one by one.
            Depending on what your browser is doing, you might be loading 1, or all of them at the same time.  
            They're all executed in that specific order though, one by one.
            
            So, there are a number of issues here when you consider performance.
            
            First of all, you are blocking rendering because you stuffed all your JavaScript into the head element.
            Next, you have a very fragile load order.  
            What if you include your coreLibrary.js last? 
            What if moduleB requires moduleA?
            Do you load all 27 modules you have on every page? 
            Load them selectively? 
            How do you handle dependency resolution? 
            Dependency calculation?
            What about CSS dependencies for UI widgets?
            
            These were just some of the issues that immediately popped in my head.  I'm sure there are plenty more.
            
            So as you can imagine, these are all issues Loader fixes.

            This final reason is easily my favorite for why we use YUI.
            
            Open Source
                The library is completely 100% open-source and hosted on Github where we're now accepting pull-requests.
                We use a BSD license, one of the most permissive licenses available.
                You don't have to be a team member to contribute code to the YUI core.  Just sign a CLA and you are good to go.
            
            Open CDN
                We even have an open CDN, the YUI Gallery, which you can use to publish whatever YUI modules you'd like.
                This is yet another feature that few, if any other, JavaScript libraries can offer.
            
            
            Open Hours
                We even have meetings in the open.  Open Hours is a 1-2 times per month hour-long meeting where we discuss with the community
                things we're working on, invite others to show off things they're doing, and answer questions anyone has.
            
            Open Development
                Pretty much everything we work on is developed in the open.
                The few things that aren't are developed with the intent to eventually be open-source.
                Our entire ticketing system, roadmap, and assignments are all visible for anyone to see.
        
            Open Documentation
                With the release of 3.4.0 and the new yuilibrary.com website, all our documentation is now available for 
                anyone to update, edit, and add examples.  
                You'll now find a /docs/ directory inside of each module where this lives.  
                It's using Selleck, a Node.js based documentation generation tool Ryan Grove developed.

        <h2>The Amazing Platypus</h2>
        <!-- 
            The reason I'm here giving you a biology lesson is because YUI, much like the platypus, has developed many unique characteristics 
            over the years as a result of the unique environment that it has evolved in.
            
            Many of the tools of the platypus can be seen elsewhere in the animal kingdom on a variety of other animals, but you only
            get one, maybe two per species, whereas the platypus is an entire package of usefulness. The amazing thing is the platypus evolved all of these
            on its own.  
            
            The bill can be seen on birds, which is good for digging
            The tail can be seen on beavers, which is good for swimming
            It lays eggs, much like a reptile
            It has webbed feet, like aquatic birds
            It is venomous like many insects and snakes
            It hunts blind and deaf, using something similar to bat sonar 
            
            It lives & sleeps on land, but hunts mostly in rivers
