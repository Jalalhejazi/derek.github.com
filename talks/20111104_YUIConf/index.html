        <h1>What is this talk about?</h1>
        <!--
            So what is this talk about?  That's a good question.  It's a bit more philosophical than most of the talks you'll see here at YUIConf.
            I originally wanted to give a talk on porting an application from another library to YUI, but I felt that was missing 
            the story of why you would want to do that in the first place.  So as I talked to other developers on the YUI team and within the community
            about their favorite parts of the library, and why it is they used YUI, I began to see some patterns emerge.  So this talk is a 
            reflection of those conversations. 
            
            In short, it's a talk about what makes YUI the most uniquely ideal toolkit to build high-scale, maintainable Web applications.

            there's likely not too many lessons we can learn from it about software development.

            The International Space Station wasn't designed with beauty in mind, but it's undeniably there.
            To me, the beauty of the IIS in this picture isn't really because of any visual elements, but of the structure itself.
            
            When we talk about architecture in the sense of software, we're talking about something very similar to the design of something like the IIS.
            Well architected software is composed of reusable and interchangeable components in a way that promotes reliability, maintainability, 
            compatibility, and extensibility.
            
            So let's take a look at some of those "ilities"

    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <h1>Modules</h1>
        <!--
            Modules are a concept used across many engineering disciplines.  
            In a space station sense, they refer to the 32 separately constructed components that compose the IIS.
            In a software sense, they similarly refer to bits of focused, interchangeable components that you can use to construct whatever system you are tasked with.
            You'll find native module support in many programming languages.  Ruby, Java, Python.  But unfortunately not in JavaScript.  Why?
            Well, it's pretty obvious.  JavaScript was developed over the course of a few weeks.  I don't think that was a consideration.
            To everyone's surprise though, JS has thrived, and the need for them is there, 
            so it's been left up to developers to design their own module patterns.
        -->
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>JS Modules</h2>
        <pre class="slide"><code class="prettyprint">// yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/
myLibrary.fizzbuzz = (function () {

  var somePrivateVar = "Fizz";
  
  return {
    fizzbuzz: myPrivateVar + " Buzz"
  };
  
})();</code></pre>

        <!-- 
            Here is just one example of a JavaScript module, as proposed on the yuiblog 4 years ago.
            You start with assigning an anonymous function to whatever you want to name your module.  
            Inside this module, you can create whatever private variables you'd like, and you return 
            an object containing things you would like to publicly expose.
            Finally, you execute and return your anonymous function.
            
            There are a number of strengths and weaknesses to this design, and over time, the YUI team finally settled on 
            similar, but slightly different design for YUI.
        -->

    </div>
    
    
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>YUI Modules</h2>
        <pre><code class="prettyprint">// fizzbuzz.js

YUI.add("fizzbuzz", function(Y){

  // Private variable
  var myPrivateVar = "Fizz";

  // Export as public variable
  Y.fizzbuzz = myPrivateVar + " buzz";

});</code></pre>

    
    <!-- 
        This module does the exact same thing the previous example did, the implementation is slightly different though.
        
        You have the same capabilities for private members, and whatever you'd like to expose to the public is attached to the Y object.
        
        Modules are a core building block for everything you do in YUI.  Between the Core library and the YUI Gallery, 
        you'll see over 600 modules that you can use inside of your application to do everything from DOM manipulation,
        animation, object-oriented helpers, and many more.
        
        It is not intended that you use all of them at the same time, but rather to pick and chose only the ones you want.

        <!-- 
            YUI is one of the few popular JavaScript libraries that uses this modular architecture, 
            but we're seeing greater adoption from other libraries.  We're even starting to see standards emerge, such as AMD and CommonJS.
            
            Dojo is has recently adopted the AMD pattern, and CommonJS Modules/1.1 is very popular within Node.js.  
            
            YUI is really happy with YUI Modules so far, but that's not to say we haven't begun exploring additional support for other formats.  
            If you are curious about the work being done here, check out the YUI forum for discussion about this topic.  
            We're very interested in hearing your feedback.            
            
            The eventual goal is native ECMAScript modules, which are coming, but they're still in the proposal phase.  
            When they've finally arrived, we still won't be able to use them in an environment that needs to support legacy browsers because they 
            won't be compatible with ES3, so I'm not sure how much adoption they'll actually have inside of browsers.  We'll see.
            
            This makes it even more important that we as a JavaScript community come up with a standard that it both backwards, and forwards compatible,
            and one that also runs equally as well server-side and within browsers.

            This is the idea that a your code is designed with future growth in mind.  Even, to be able to grow in ways it was never intended.
            When working within a library, it's extremely important that you consider all types of edge-cases, and make it possible for
            developers to replace or extend your functionality with their own.
            
            When you think about extensibility with software, a good comparison might be Lightning McQueen.
            This specific toy was designed to only 1 thing, look exactly like Lightning McQueen did in the movie Cars.  
            I'd say they did a pretty good job.  But the problem is what happens in the next sequel when Lightning 
            is getting older and needs rocket boosters, or the sequel after that when he has a midlife crisis and wants to be a convertible.
